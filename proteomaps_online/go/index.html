    <h1>Proteomaps based on Gene Ontology</h1>

<p style="font-size:11pt; width:650;">Proteomaps can be created based
on any user-defined hierarchy tree.  The following images of
<it>S. cerevisiae</it> proteome (data from Lu <it>et al.</it>, 2007)
were created with the widely used and flexible <a
href="www.geneontology.org">Gene Ontology</a> (GO).

<table style="{background-color:#ffffff">

<p style="font-size:11pt; width:650;">
Ontologies such as GO need to be adapted to form a tree graph. In GO ontologies, many
non-terminal nodes are under several more general terms
simultaneously. In addition, GO - being a directed acyclic graph
rather than a tree - contains terms that are located at different
distances from the root. Finally, the dynamic nature of GO contains
for some genes more than 10 levels and we find that for proteomaps a
more compact 3-level hierarchy is easier to visually comprehend.
