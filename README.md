===================

Code, proteomics data, and other resources for generating proteomaps graphics and proteomovies

For general information about proteomaps, see www.proteomaps.net


## 1. Directories

DOCUMENTATION
  documentation - General documentation
  proteomovies  - Instructions and example files for generating proteomovies

CODE
  python - python code
  matlab - matlab code

DATA RESOURCES (information about proteins, hierarchy of protein functions)
  genomic_data

PROTEOME DATA (storage space for data at different stages of processing)
  data_original     - directories with original proteomics data
  data_sets         - data preprocessing (one directory for each data bundle)
  data_paver_input  - input data for paver
  data_paver_output - output data generated by paver (images and html files)
  data_html         - processed html (to be copied into website directory)


## 2. Installation

For running the python and matlab code on your computer, you need to update the path names.
They are set in the following files:

../python/proteomaps_PATHNAMES.py
../matlab/proteomaps_path_names.m

Of course, also the path names in your scripts CreateProteomaps.sh have to be adjusted.


## 3. How to generate proteomaps

Data sets to be analysed together are called a "bundle". To create 
a new data bundle (called [DATA_BUNDLE]), create a new directory 
for the data bundle, with directory name: ../data_sets/[DATA BUNDLE]

Within this directory, prepare the necessary control files (for file 
formats, have a look at the corresponding files in existing file bundle 
directories)

 o create the file filenames.csv with all necessary information

 o create a new directory for the paver input files 
   directory name: ../data_paver_input/data_for_paver_[DATA BUNDLE]

 o create a new directory for the paver output files 
   directory name: ../data_paver_output/proteomaps_[DATA BUNDLE]

 o create a new shell script CreateProteomaps.sh calling CreateProteomaps.py

 o run the shell script

This will create intermediate files in ../data_sets/[DATA BUNDLE] as well as
files for paver in ../data_paver_input/data_for_paver_[DATA BUNDLE]

Then, proceed as follows:

 o run paver with the input files from 
   ../data_paver_input/data_for_paver_[DATA BUNDLE]

 o save the output files in 
   ../data_paver_output/proteomaps_[DATA BUNDLE]

 o use the script Make_proteomaps_html.py to create the html files
   in ../data_html/
   (you will have to edit the script and create a new entry for your 
    file bundle; use the syntax you see in the existing entries)

 o If you want to put the new proteomaps on the Proteomaps online website,
   use copy_files_to_website.py. You have to modify the script: insert the 
   [DATA_ BUNDLE] in the list "data_set_collections" and run the script.


## 4. How to generate proteomovies

To generate proteomovies from your data files, please see the instructions in proteomaps-workflow/proteomovies/README
