<h3>Proteome tree maps visualization</h3>

<p>To generate proteomaps, we modified the algorithm
for the construction of Voronoi treemaps described in bernhardt et
al. (2009) to present polygons with variable sizes. The algorithm was
implemented in the <a href="http://www.decodon.com/paver.html">Paver
software</a> (DECODON (Greifswald, Germany)). Example maps can be
browsed interactively; individual protein tiles are linked to protein
information on the <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG
website</a>.</p>

<p>In the proteomaps shown here, we visualize three
levels of functional categories and a level of individual proteins. To
create a proteomap, a total area is first divided into polygons
representing the top-level categories. These polygons are constructed
from a Voronoi diagram, where the polygons' areas were chosen to
represent copy numbers weighted by protein chain lengths (the
investment in terms of amino acids, also termed the mass
fraction). The top-level areas are then subdivided into subcategories
and the procedure is repeated down to the level of individual
proteins. When several orthologous proteins exist in the same
proteome, e.g. isozymes such as the two enolases Eno1 and Eno2 in
yeast glycolysis, they share one subdivided polygon.</p>

<p>Proteins that do not have a functional category
annotation are lumped in a subclass labeled "Not mapped". Mass
fractions smaller than 1/1,500,000 of the whole proteome (corresponding
to 4 pixels within an area of 2500 x 2500 pixels in size) are
excluded. The arrangement of categories and proteins over the area is
kept as consistent as possible between proteomaps. To ensure a similar
layout across datasets, a template proteomap can be used to initialize
proteomaps for other data sets at the highest hierarchy
level. However, due to differences in protein abundances, congruent
arrangements cannot always be fully achieved. Colors are used for
association within functional categories and have no quantitative
meaning. Specifically, small variations in color are used to
differentiate among detailed functional categories within the same
broad functional category, e.g. shades of blue within "Genetic
Information Processing".</p>

<h3>Protein abundance data sources and gene mapping</h3>

<p style="width:700">Protein data were taken from the original
publications and from the proteome database <a
href="pax-db.org">PaxDb</a>. Criteria for choosing data sets to be
included were: a high proteome coverage; quantitative values that are
proportional to abundance, ideally reported as absolute numbers; and
refraining from biases such as mixed cell types or a known strong
misrepresentation of cellular compartments or functions. All proteomes
had been quantified by mass spectrometry, except for the data from
Newman et al. (2006) which were quantified by fluorescence of
GFP-tagged proteins. To assign proteins to functional categories,
systematic gene names (ORF names) were annotated with KEGG Orthology
identifiers. Protein chain lengths were obtained from
Uniprot. Proteins of unknown length, due to mapping issues, were
assigned a standard length of 350 amino acids.</p>

<h3>Protein functional hierarchy and category assignment</h3>

<p style="width:700">KEGG pathway maps were chosen as a basis for our
functional gene hierarchy because of their clearly layered structure,
which shows protein functions in different categories on a comparable
degree of resolution. Proteins are assigned to functions via Kegg
Orthology (KO) IDs, which makes them comparable between organisms.</p>

<p style="width:700">The same protein can be assigned to multiple
functional categories. Voronoi Treemaps, in contrast, require a
tree-like hierarchy. To assign each KO ID to a single bottom-level
category, we had to define a default priority order between the
functional categories, in which, for instance, assignments to
"Transcription" would override assignments to "Metabolism". The
default choice can be overridden by manual assignments. Moreover, we
found that for consistency with the literature some functional
categories had to be added, renamed, or restructured. The customized
version of the KEGG hierarchy can be downloaded <a href="download.html">here</a>.</p>

<p style="width:700">Since each KO ID appears, on average, in about
two pathway categories, our priority order can create a bias towards
certain categories. To quantify this bias, we randomized the priority
order and computed median values and uncertainty ranges for category
areas arising from different possible protein annotations. We find
that random reassignments had only little effect on the overall
category areas and that none of our qualitative observations change
substantially.</p>

<p style="width:700">The KEGG hierarchy proved useful for the present
purpose, but proteomaps can also be produced with other classification
trees such as TIGRFams, the original KEGG pathway maps, the MIPS
Functional Catalogue, <a href="http://www.theseed.org">TheSEED</a>, Riley
scheme derived classification systems, and many more. Ontologies such
as the widely used and flexible <href="geneontology.org">Gene
Ontology</a> (GO) are typically directed acyclic graphs rather than a
tree. In GO, many non-terminal nodes are connected to several
higher-level terms, and terminal terms are located at different
distances from the root; for some genes, GO contains more than 10
hierarchy levels. We found that proteomaps with a compact 3-level
hierarchy are useful for visual comprehension. Thus, adapting GO
requires adaptation beyond the scope of this study.</p>
